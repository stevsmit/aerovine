# **🛡️ AeroVine Non-Compete and Non-Solicitation Agreement**

This **Non-Compete and Non-Solicitation Agreement** (the "Agreement") is entered into this **\[Date\]**, by and between **AeroVine** (the "Company") and **\[Employee Name\]** (the "Employee").

## **1\. Consideration**

In consideration of the Employee's employment, access to the Company's Proprietary Information (including AI models, software, and drone technology), specialized training, and other compensation, the Employee agrees to the following covenants.

## **2\. Non-Competition**

The Employee agrees that during their employment with AeroVine and for a period of **\[Duration, e.g., twelve (12) months\]** following the voluntary or involuntary termination of their employment (the "Restricted Period"), the Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control, be employed by, or participate in the ownership, management, operation, or control of, any **Competitive Business**.

**A. Definition of Competitive Business:** A **Competitive Business** is defined as any person or entity engaged in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling, developing, or providing services related to **Autonomous Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), drone fleet management software, or specialized Artificial Intelligence/Computer Vision systems for aerial data collection or navigation**, that operates within the **\[Geographic Scope, e.g., the United States and Canada, or a 50-mile radius of the Company’s principal office\]**.

**B. Scope Limit:** This covenant does not prohibit the Employee from purchasing or owning less than two percent (2%) of the publicly traded stock of any corporation.

## **3\. Non-Solicitation of Employees**

The Employee acknowledges that AeroVine invests substantial resources in recruiting, training, and retaining its specialized technical and management personnel.

During the Restricted Period, the Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit, recruit, or attempt to solicit or recruit any person who is, or was within the preceding **\[Duration, e.g., six (6) months\]**, an employee, contractor, or consultant of AeroVine, to terminate their relationship with the Company or to engage in any Competitive Business.
