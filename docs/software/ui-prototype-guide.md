## 🎬 Demo Script (5-Minute Walkthrough)

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
*[Open acme-ai-dashboard.html in browser]*

"This is Acme.ai's agricultural drone fleet management platform. We specialize in both large-scale farming AND premium vineyards."

---

### **Dashboard Overview (1 minute)**
*[Show Dashboard tab]*

"At a glance, we're managing 50 drones across 47 farms globally. Today alone we've surveyed 12,450 hectares with 89% AI autonomy."

**Point to the alerts:**
"Our AI just detected powdery mildew in our Napa Valley vineyard - a disease that can devastate wine grapes. It identified the exact location: Block 7, affecting only 2.3 hectares."

**Point to economic impact:**
"This precision saves money - $127,400 in chemical savings last month by treating only affected areas, not entire fields."

---

### **Vineyard Specialization (2 minutes)**
*[Click on "Vineyards" tab]*

"Here's where we differentiate - premium vineyard management. Wine grapes can be worth $3,000-$8,000 per ton compared to $200 for wheat. That's why precision matters."

*[Click on Napa Valley card - popup appears]*

"For this Cabernet Sauvignon vineyard in Napa, our AI detected powdery mildew early - before the winemaker could see it with the naked eye. The recommendation: precision fungicide application on just 2.3 hectares instead of spraying all 85 hectares."

**Economics:**
"That single detection saved:
- 65% in chemical costs
- Prevented disease spread to healthy vines
- Maintained premium wine quality
- Protected the vineyard's $2.5M+ annual revenue"

*[Point to other vineyards]*

"We monitor vineyards across three continents - Napa, Sonoma, Willamette Valley in the US, Mendoza in Argentina, Tuscany in Italy. Each has unique challenges: heat stress in Italy, irrigation needs in Argentina, disease pressure in Oregon."

---

### **Live Operations (1 minute)**
*[Click on "Fleet" tab]*

"Right now, Drone V-08 is surveying our Pinot Noir vineyard in Russian River. You can see its battery level, mission progress, and estimated completion time."

*[Point to active drones]*

"Simultaneously, we have drones operating in traditional agriculture - wheat surveys in Iowa, corn field spraying. The platform manages both premium vineyards and commodity crops."

---

### **Analytics & ROI (30 seconds)**
*[Click on "Analytics" tab]*

"The analytics prove the value. In our vineyards specifically:
- 93% disease detection accuracy
- 89% yield prediction confidence
- $89,200 saved in chemical costs through precision
- Estimated crop value of $847,000 - up 12% through early intervention"

---

### **Closing (30 seconds)**

"This platform demonstrates that Acme.ai isn't just another drone company. We combine:
- **Agricultural Expertise** - Understanding crop needs
- **AI Technology** - 93% detection accuracy
- **Premium Market Focus** - Vineyards are high-value
- **Global Scale** - Operating across continents
- **Economic Impact** - Real savings, real ROI"

## 💡 Key Talking Points for Vineyards

### **Why Vineyards Need Drones:**

1. **Disease Detection**
   - Powdery mildew can destroy entire vintage
   - Early detection = 90%+ crop saved
   - Our AI detects 5-7 days before visible symptoms

2. **Precision Irrigation**
   - Water stress affects sugar content (critical for wine quality)
   - Over-watering dilutes flavor
   - Our thermal imaging identifies stress zones

3. **Canopy Management**
   - Too dense = disease risk + poor sun exposure
   - Too sparse = sunburn damage
   - AI measures optimal density

4. **Harvest Timing**
   - Picking too early = under-ripe, acidic
   - Picking too late = over-ripe, low acidity
   - AI predicts optimal harvest window based on berry development

5. **Premium Market Economics**
   - $3,000-$8,000 per ton vs commodity crops ($200/ton)
   - Small improvements = huge financial impact
   - Vineyard owners WILL pay for technology that protects investment

## 🎓 Vineyard Terminology (Sound Like an Expert)

### **Diseases to Mention:**
- **Powdery Mildew** - White fungal growth, most common
- **Downy Mildew** - Yellowing leaves, destructive
- **Botrytis** (Noble Rot) - Can be good or bad depending on wine type

### **Growth Stages:**
- **Bud Break** - Spring growth begins
- **Flowering** - Critical for pollination
- **Fruit Set** - Berries form
- **Veraison** - Grapes change color, sugar accumulation
- **Harvest** - Picking at optimal ripeness

### **Metrics:**
- **Brix** - Sugar content (directly related to alcohol %)
- **pH** - Acidity level
- **Canopy Density** - Leaf coverage
- **Berry Size** - Uniformity important for quality
- **Tons per hectare (t/ha)** - Yield measurement

## ❓ Anticipated Questions & Answers

### **Q: Why focus on vineyards AND traditional agriculture?**
A: "Vineyards are high-margin, premium clients who pay for precision. Traditional agriculture provides volume and scale. Together, they create a balanced business model - high revenue per acre from vineyards, high volume from commodity crops."

### **Q: How accurate is the disease detection in vineyards?**
A: "93% accuracy for powdery mildew, downy mildew, and botrytis. We trained our AI on 50,000+ labeled images from UC Davis Viticulture Department and real vineyard data. The AI detects spectral signatures invisible to the human eye - identifying disease 5-7 days before visible symptoms."

### **Q: What's different about monitoring vineyards vs other crops?**
A: "Vineyards require more frequent monitoring - weekly vs monthly for row crops. Disease pressure is higher. The economic value is 15-40x higher per hectare. And precision matters more - a 5% quality improvement can mean premium pricing tier changes worth thousands of dollars."

### **Q: Do vineyard owners actually use this technology?**
A: "Absolutely. Premium wineries in Napa spend $3,000-$5,000 per acre on farming costs already. Adding $200-$400/acre for drone monitoring that can prevent a $10,000/acre crop loss is an easy decision. Plus, they can market 'sustainable, precision viticulture' to consumers."

### **Q: What about regulations? Can you fly drones over vineyards?**
A: "Yes, with FAA Part 107 commercial drone license. Vineyards are typically rural, outside no-fly zones. We maintain compliance with all agricultural aviation regulations and spray permit requirements."
