## AeroVine: Precision Viticulture Takes Flight

AeroVine's core offering centers on high-resolution aerial imagery and proprietary analytical software designed specifically for the unique challenges of viticulture. Traditional vineyard monitoring is labor-intensive and often relies on broad assumptions. AeroVine's technology overcomes these limitations by delivering detailed, plant-level data, including:

- **Vigor Mapping:** Using multispectral and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analysis to identify variations in vine health across the block.

- **Water Stress Detection:** Pinpointing specific areas suffering from dehydration, allowing for targeted irrigation adjustments.

- **Pest and Disease Identification:** Early detection of infestations or fungal outbreaks before they spread widely.

- **Canopy Management Analysis:** Assessing canopy density and leaf area index (LAI) for optimal sun exposure and grape quality.

"The wine industry has always been a blend of tradition and science, but the 'science' side is about to get a major upgrade," said Shauna Diaz, CEO of AeroVine. "We are not just selling drone flights; we are providing actionable, geo-referenced intelligence that helps winemakers make better, faster decisions. Our technology is designed to save water, reduce pesticide use, and ultimately, produce a superior vintage."

## Strategic Partnership and Pilot Programs

AeroVine has successfully completed pilot programs with several regional vineyards, demonstrating significant improvements in efficiency and grape quality.

"Working with AeroVine has been a game-changer for our Cabernet Sauvignon blocks. The data allowed us to identify subtle irrigation issues we couldn't see from the ground and adjust our strategy in time. This kind of precision is the future of fine winemaking," said Henry Partner from Henry's Vineyard.

The company is currently accepting new clients for its Summer 2025 service package and plans to focus on Willamette Valley and Finger Lakes before expanding nationally.
