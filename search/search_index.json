The AI analyzes multispectral imagery - specifically the near-infrared and red-edge bands that show chlorophyll content. Diseased plants have different spectral signatures than healthy ones. For powdery mildew specifically, we look for reduced reflectance in the 700-750nm range, which indicates fungal interference with photosynthesis.

Each farm's data is completely siloed - Vineyard A cannot see Vineyard B's data. We never sell data to third parties.

The vineyard manager still walks the rows, but now they know WHERE to look. Instead of inspecting 85 hectares randomly, the AI says 'check Block 7, north corner.'

Early detection allows for Variable Rate Deficit Irrigation (VRDI) prescription maps, ensuring optimal stress levels for quality. Powdery Mildew Risk: If undetected early, infection can reduce yield by 50% and lower wine quality significantly across a block. Drone-guided Spot Treatment minimizes chemical use and prevents widespread outbreak, protecting investment. Grapevine Trunk Disease Risk: Systemic disease requires costly vine removal and re-planting, with a $15,000\u2013$40,000 per-acre loss of production over 3-5 years. Enhanced spectral imaging detects sub-clinical symptoms before visual decline, isolating diseased vines for proactive removal. Red Blotch / Leaf Roll Virus Risk: Quality loss (poor color and flavor development) can drop a wine's tier classification, resulting in a $20\u2013$50 loss per bottle. Mapping disease spread allows for targeted pruning/removal, protecting clean surrounding blocks and quality control.

It's as simple as checking email.\"</p> <p>For Customers Who Want to Operate Their Own Drones:</p> <p>\"For customers who prefer to own and operate drones, we offer the AeroVine-X7-AG platform - a pre-configured agricultural drone with multispectral and thermal cameras.

We're cloud-agnostic - AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. The frontend is a responsive web app (React/Vue), backend is Python FastAPI with PostgreSQL + PostGIS for geospatial data. Real-time telemetry uses WebSocket streaming.

Edge AI Processing - We run AI inference on the drones themselves using NVIDIA Jetson processors. NDVI is calculated in real-time during flight, not hours later when you get back to the office.

We trained CNNs on 50,000+ labeled images of wine grape diseases - powdery mildew, downy mildew, botrytis - in vineyard conditions. That specificity gives us 93% accuracy vs 65% for generic agricultural AI.</p> <p>3. Time-Series Optimization - We use TimescaleDB for drone telemetry. We can replay any flight from the past 2 years with full sensor data - GPS coordinates, battery levels, wind conditions - at 10Hz resolution.
