## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

**Target Profile:** The **Premium Quality-Driven Vineyard** (30–500 acres), which prioritizes consistent quality and risk mitigation to maintain high retail price points.

### I. Firmographics (Who They Are)

| Category | ICP Definition | Rationale |
|:--------|:--------------|:----------|
| **Vineyard Acreage Range** | **30 to 500 Acres** | Optimal balance for precision services: large enough to justify investment, small enough for individual vine attention. |
| **Annual Wine Production** | **3,000 to 45,000 cases** | Corresponds to the premium size where quality is prioritized over mass market volume. |
| **Wine Price Point/Bottle** | **$40 to $150+ (Retail)** | High price point ensures a strong **ROI** from marginal quality improvements and risk mitigation. |
| **Annual Revenue Range** | **$5 Million to $40 Million** | Indicates the necessary budget capacity for high-end, strategic AgTech solutions. |
| **Geographic Locations** | **1. Napa/Sonoma (CA), 2. Willamette Valley (OR), 3. Bordeaux (France), 4. Tuscany (Italy), 5. Barossa Valley (Australia)** | Regions with high climate risk, high brand value, and established precision viticulture practices. |
| **Number of Employees** | **20 to 150** | Indicates a dedicated operations team that requires streamlined, actionable data for efficiency. |

### II. Technographics (What They Use)

| Category | ICP Definition | Rationale |
|:--------|:--------------|:----------|
| **Current Technology Adoption** | **Moderate to High Adopter** | Already investing in technology (weather stations, soil probes) but seeking predictive, integrated systems. |
| **Existing Ag Tools** | **GIS Mapping/GPS, IoT Soil Moisture Sensors, Basic Satellite Imagery** | They understand precision farming but are constrained by low-resolution, generic data. |
| **Data Analytics Capabilities** | **Dedicated Analyst or Consulting Viticulturist** | They have the personnel who can quickly consume and act on sophisticated data outputs (e.g., prescription maps). |
| **IT Infrastructure** | **Established Vineyard Management Software (e.g., VinNOW, SAP, Dynamics)** | Requires solutions that are **API-compatible** or offer easy export for integration into existing financial and operational workflows. |

### III. Behavioral (How They Buy)

| Category | ICP Definition | Rationale |
|:--------|:--------------|:----------|
| **Decision-Making Timeline** | **4–12 Weeks** (Fast for pilot, slower for annual contract) | Sales must focus on a quick, guaranteed-ROI pilot to unlock the larger annual contract budget. |
| **Budget Cycle** | **Q4 (Planning for next vintage) and Q1 (Start of growing season)** | Key spending decisions are made when planning the input costs (labor, water, chemicals) for the coming year. |
| **Approval Chain** | **Operations/Vineyard Director (Recommendation) → Owner/CFO (Final Sign-off)** | Must prove both operational benefit (Director) and financial risk mitigation/ROI (CFO/Owner). |
| **Typical Objections** | **"The data quality isn't better than my consultant's eye."** **"We already have satellite imagery."** **"It's too complex for my field crew."** | Sales must overcome skepticism regarding data *accuracy* and the perceived **implementation burden**. |
| **Preferred Vendors** | **Works closely with Viticulture Consultants/Agronomists** | These consultants are essential partners and influencers that AeroVine must successfully collaborate with. |

### IV. Top Pain Points (The Problems AeroVine Solves)

AeroVine provides solutions to critical issues that directly impact the value of a premium vintage:

1. **Late Disease Detection:** Missing early-stage diseases (like trunk diseases) until visible symptoms appear, leading to non-recoverable crop loss.
2. **Water/Input Inefficiency:** Wasting resources by applying uniform irrigation/fungicide across variable blocks, which elevates costs and reduces grape quality.
3. **Lack of Quality Uniformity:** High variability in ripening (Brix/Acidity) across a block, forcing difficult harvest decisions and lowering the quality grade of the final blend.
4. **Labor Cost/Scarcity:** Reliance on expensive, highly-skilled manual labor for scouting and precise vineyard management tasks.
5. **Uncertain Yield Forecasting:** Inability to accurately predict harvest tonnage and quality 60–90 days out, impacting sales contracts and winery capacity planning.

### V. ICP Scorecard for Sales Reps

Use this scorecard during initial qualification. A **Target Lead** should score **10 points or higher** in the *Total Score* column.

### Market Trends & Operating Environment

| Category | Current Challenges Facing Vineyard Operators | Technology Adoption Trends |
|:---------|:--------------------------------------------|:---------------------------|
| **Challenges** | **1. Climate Volatility:** Increasing frequency of extreme heat/drought events necessitates hyper-precise irrigation (VRDI). **2. Labor Crisis:** Rising cost and scarcity of skilled labor for critical tasks (e.g., precise pruning, scouting). **3. Disease Pressure:** Increased threat from systemic diseases (e.g., trunk diseases) and pests due to climate change. **4. Compliance:** Growing pressure for sustainable and water-efficient farming practices (e.g., Lodi Rules, Napa Green). | **1. Predictive Analytics:** Shift from descriptive data ("what happened") to predictive models ("what will happen") regarding yield and quality. **2. Automation:** Focus on robotics and drones for tasks where labor is scarce (spraying, monitoring). **3. IoT Integration:** Connecting soil sensors, weather stations, and drone data to centralized Farm Management Systems (FMS). |
| **Growth Regions** | **Top 5 Regions Experiencing Growth/Investment:** Napa/Sonoma (CA), Willamette Valley (OR), Marlborough (NZ), Rhône Valley (France), Mendoza (Argentina) | **Regulations:** Increasing scrutiny on water usage, pesticide drift, and labor safety/wage compliance. **Drones offer auditable proof** of precision application and resource efficiency. |

### Key Diseases & Issues Drones Detect (The Cost Impact)

AeroVine's multispectral and AI analysis provides early detection, which translates directly into cost mitigation and quality preservation.

| Issue Detected | Cost Impact & Rationale for Premium Vineyards | Solution Focus |
|:--------------|:---------------------------------------------|:---------------|
| **Water Stress** | **Risk:** Loss of *uniformity* in ripening (Brix/Acid), reducing wine quality grade. | Early detection allows for **Variable Rate Deficit Irrigation (VRDI)** prescription maps, ensuring optimal stress levels for quality. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | **Risk:** If undetected early, infection can reduce yield by **50%** and lower wine quality significantly across a block. | Drone-guided **Spot Treatment** minimizes chemical use and prevents widespread outbreak, protecting investment. |
| **Grapevine Trunk Disease** | **Risk:** Systemic disease requires costly vine removal and re-planting, with a $15,000–$40,000 per-acre loss of production over 3-5 years. | Enhanced spectral imaging detects sub-clinical symptoms **before** visual decline, isolating diseased vines for proactive removal. |
| **Red Blotch / Leaf Roll Virus** | **Risk:** Quality loss (poor color and flavor development) can drop a wine's tier classification, resulting in a $20–$50 loss per bottle. | Mapping disease spread allows for targeted pruning/removal, protecting clean surrounding blocks and quality control. |
| **Pest Damage** | **Risk:** Localized damage from insects or birds can quickly destroy specific high-value rows. | High-resolution mapping identifies damage hotspots, informing placement of deterrents or targeted biocontrol applications. |

### Buying Season & Outreach Strategy

| Stage of Season | When They Buy (Budget Cycle) | Best Time for AeroVine Outreach |
|:---------------|:----------------------------|:--------------------------------|
| **Winter** | **Primary Decision Window (Q4/Q1):** Budgets finalized for the upcoming season; input costs (labor, chemicals) are set. | **December - February:** Focus on **ROI and Annual Contracts.** Target the Ops Director with savings data. |
| **Pre-Harvest** | **Urgent Problem Solving (Q3):** Seeking immediate, high-value fixes to secure the vintage (e.g., ripeness uniformity mapping). | **July - August:** Focus on **Pilot Programs and Quality Assurance.** Target the Vintner with quality elevation data. |
