### Day 2 - The Problem: Manual Scouting
**Post Type:** Educational/Problem-focused
**Platform:** LinkedIn, Facebook

**Copy:**
❌ The Hidden Cost of Manual Vineyard Scouting

Your team can't be everywhere at once. Manual scouting is:
• Labor-intensive and costly
• Misses issues in difficult-to-access blocks
• Time-consuming across vast acreage

What if you could get comprehensive vineyard insights in under 24 hours—without sending your team into every block?

That's the AeroVine advantage.

### Day 3 - The Problem: Satellite Data Limitations
**Post Type:** Educational/Problem-focused
**Platform:** LinkedIn, Twitter

**Copy:**
⏰ Too Late: Why Satellite Data Falls Short

By the time satellite imagery alerts you to a problem, damage has often already occurred. Low-resolution data means you're reacting, not preventing.

AeroVine delivers:
✅ High-resolution, hyper-local data
✅ Actionable insights in under 24 hours
✅ Single-vine level precision

The data that tastes better. 🍷
