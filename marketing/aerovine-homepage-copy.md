# From Guesswork to Grape Quality - Why Manual Scouting Fails

Traditional vineyard management relies on methods that can't keep pace with modern viticulture demands:

- **Labor Intensive:** Manual scouting is costly and misses critical issues in vast, difficult-to-access vineyard blocks. Your team can't be everywhere at once.

- **Too Late:** Satellite data is often low-resolution and slow, alerting you to problems only after damage has occurred. By then, it's already impacting your harvest quality and yield.

AeroVine provides the solution: Automated drone missions and AI analysis deliver actionable insights in under 24 hours. The data that tastes better.
