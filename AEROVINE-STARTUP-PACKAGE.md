| $10K-30K per farm | $50K-200K per vineyard |

---

### **Elevator Pitch (30 seconds):**

> "AeroVine provides AI-powered drone fleet management for premium vineyards globally. This morning, our system detected powdery mildew in 2.3 hectares of a Napa Valley Cabernet vineyard - not the entire 85 hectares. Precision treatment saved $12,620 in chemicals and prevented disease spread. We monitor 462 hectares across California, Argentina, and Italy, providing winery owners with real-time vine health data and early disease detection that protects multi-million dollar harvests."

---

## 💰 The Economics of Vineyard Specialization

### **Why Vineyards = Premium Market:**

**Wine Grapes Value:**
- $3,000 - $8,000 per ton (premium varieties)
- Cabernet Sauvignon: $3,500 - $6,000/ton
- Pinot Noir: $2,500 - $5,000/ton
- Chardonnay: $2,000 - $4,000/ton

**Compare to Commodity Crops:**
- Wheat: $200 - $250/ton
- Corn: $150 - $200/ton
- Soybeans: $400 - $500/ton

**The Math:**
- 85-hectare Napa Cabernet vineyard
- 3 tons/hectare yield
- $4,500/ton average price
- **= $1.15 million annual crop value**

**One powdery mildew outbreak can destroy:**
- 30-50% of crop if untreated
- $345K - $575K in losses
- **AeroVine early detection = $500K+ saved**

## 🎬 10-Minute Demo Script

### **[0:00-0:30] Opening**
*[Open aerovine-dashboard.html]*

"Good morning. I'm presenting **AeroVine** - an AI-powered agricultural drone platform specializing in premium vineyard management."

*[Gesture to screen]*

"The name says it all: **Aero** for aerial technology, **Vine** for our vineyard expertise."

---

### **[0:30-2:00] The Problem**
*[Point to Dashboard stats]*

"Traditional viticulture has a problem: vineyard managers spray entire fields uniformly because they can't see disease until it's visible - which is often too late."

*[Point to crop health chart showing 5% diseased]*

"See this? Only 5% of crops actually have disease. But without our technology, farmers spray 100% of the field. That's wasted chemicals, wasted money, and environmental damage."

**For vineyards specifically:**
- Powdery mildew can spread from 5% to 50% in 2 weeks
- Premium Cabernet grapes worth $4,500/ton
- Disease outbreak = $500,000+ in losses
- Early detection is everything

---

### **[2:00-4:30] The Solution - Vineyard Focus**
*[Click "Vineyards" tab]*

"This is where AeroVine differentiates. We specialize in premium vineyards - wine grapes worth $3,000 to $8,000 per ton, which is 15 to 40 times more valuable than commodity crops."

*[Click on Napa Valley Estate card - popup appears]*

"This morning at 6 AM, our AI detected powdery mildew in our client's Napa Valley vineyard. But not the entire 85 hectares - just 2.3 hectares in Block 7."

**Walk through the economics:**
- "Traditional approach: spray all 85 hectares = $13,000 in chemicals"
- "AeroVine approach: precision spray 2.3 hectares = $380"
- "**Savings: $12,620 on this single detection**"
- "Plus: prevented spread to the other 82.7 hectares worth $1.1 million"

**Why this matters:**
"The AI caught it 5-7 days before visible symptoms. At that point, you have options: preventative spray costs $380. Emergency treatment after spread costs $13,000+. Crop loss costs $500,000."

## ❓ Anticipated Questions with AeroVine Answers

### **Q: Why "AeroVine" instead of something more generic?**
**A:** "The name immediately signals our positioning. When a Napa winery owner hears 'AeroVine,' they know we understand viticulture, not just agriculture. It's the difference between going to a specialist versus a general practitioner. We speak their language: veraison, brix levels, canopy management, AVAs."

### **Q: Is the vineyard focus limiting your market?**
**A:** "Quite the opposite. Premium vineyards pay 5-10x more per hectare than commodity farms. Our ARR per vineyard customer is $50K-200K vs $10K-30K for regular farms. Plus, we're not vineyard-only - we serve both markets. Think of it like enterprise software: you chase enterprise deals for margin, SMB for volume. Same strategy."

### **Q: What about other high-value crops like almonds or citrus?**
**A:** "Excellent question. Our AI approach is transferable. We started with vineyards because: (1) highest value per acre, (2) very disease-sensitive, (3) owners sophisticated about tech. Once we prove ROI here, we'll expand to almonds ($7K/ton), pistachios, specialty citrus. The viticul ture market validates our premium positioning."

### **Q: How accurate is disease detection really?**
**A:** "93% accuracy for powdery mildew, downy mildew, and botrytis. We trained our models on 50,000+ labeled images from UC Davis Viticulture Department plus real vineyard data from three growing seasons. The AI analyzes spectral signatures in the 700-750nm range that indicate chlorophyll disruption from fungal infection. Ground-truth validation shows 87% of our alerts occur 5-7 days before vineyard managers see visible symptoms."

### **Q: Have you actually built this?**
**A:** "For this simulation, I've created professional technical specifications - the complete API documentation, a functional UI prototype, and architectural designs. This represents Phase 1 of software development: requirements and planning. In a real startup, this work would guide our engineering team's implementation. The quality of this documentation demonstrates I understand what to build, why it creates value, and how systems integrate - which is exactly what software department members contribute in early-stage startups."

### **Q: What's your go-to-market strategy?**
**A:** "Three-phase approach:

**Year 1 - Premium Vineyard Launch:**
- Target: Top 500 wineries in Napa, Sonoma, Willamette Valley
- Sales: Direct + wine industry trade shows (Unified Wine & Grape Symposium)
- Pricing: $50K-200K per winery depending on acreage
